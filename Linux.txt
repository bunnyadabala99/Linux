File Structure
* In Linux everything is treated as a file or folder
* bin and Sbin will be created for every individual user 
  
/ - root user
bin - all cmnds and config files
Sbin - user information and the related files along with configurations
boot - System booting information 
dev - device related and storage attachments & partision files
etc - user config files like passwd, cmnds 
mnt - mounting of devices, external storage devices
lib - all the supporting lib files 
media - supporting files for all media related files
opt - all 3rd party files 
proc - process related information
sys - system related info like drivers, ram, device related
var - log files
usr - user related 
tmp - temporary files

man cmnd - to get manual for any cmnd
help cmnd - to get help or options for a cmnd
apropose action of cmnd - to get cmnd by the action it does
cmnd double tab - to get relevant cmnds with the short forms of cmnd names

Wildcard
* --> case sensitive
? --> first letter after filename will be displayed
[] --> sequence of files
> --> redirection or rewrite
>> --> append 


* Linux is command line based & case sensitive
* Syntax = <command-name> <Options> <inputs>
* Shell
